# Real-time-hand-gesture-recognition
Overview:

This repository is of computer vision domain and the project is real-time hand gesture recognition, converting dynamic hand gestures into text using advanced image recognition technology. The system is designed to provide a robust framework for a variety of applications, such as sign language interpretation and immersive user interfaces, allowing users to interact with digital environments using intuitive hand gestures, thus enhancing accessibility and user experience in various domains.

Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
TensorFlow
OpenCV
Jupyter Notebook
Mediapipe

6 signs were predicted using the deep learning model that was trained. Signs were: Thumbs up, Thumbs down, Call me, Fist, Peace, Stop. There was very less training data hence the accuracy is a bit low but with enough data and variety of the signs that can be added. The model can be made quite robust and effective.
